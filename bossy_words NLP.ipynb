markets, analysts said.\\n      high short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and\\n  an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of\\n  fresh funds in the last two months, largely from japanese and\\n  u.s. investors, analysts polled by reuters said.\\n      fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in\\n  and have settled on australia, britain and canada as they\\n  diversify from volatile u.s. dollar instruments, they said.\\n      a one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in\\n  the past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the\\n  currency of 0.71 u.s. dlrs all illustrated the inflow.\\n      official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital\\n  are not available, but brokers said they received almost daily\\n  inquiries from japan and the united states.\\n      \"these people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about\\n  and they don\\'t know what to do with it. some of that is ending\\n  up here with the attraction of high interest rates and\\n  reasonable currency stability,\" national australia bank ltd\\n  economist brian hamley said.\\n      \"there is a \\'flight to quality\\',\" hamley said. \"australia may\\n  not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren\\'t too\\n  many other countries where you\\'d want to put your money.\"\\n      the stronger australian dollar was also attracting\\n  investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against\\n  the volatility of the u.s. unit, analysts said.\\n      \"we\\'re looking a more favoured market than perhaps the u.s.\\n  where some people would be concerned about the value of the\\n  u.s. dollar,\" lloyds bank nza ltd chief economist will buttrose\\n  said. \"why not put the money in australia where entry is cheap\\n  and the currency looks stable?\"\\n      but turning that capital into more permanent productive\\n  investment depends on government economic policy, he said.\\n      \"it will only disappear if people lose confidence in the\\n  direction in the economy,\" buttrose said, adding that offshore\\n  investors would carefully watch the government\\'s promised tough\\n  economic statement on may 14.\\n      while happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding\\n  interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as\\n  easily reverse the flow -- particularly the japanese, who were\\n  badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the australian dollar\\n  and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.\\n      \"it will remain very edgy money. if something was not to be\\n  delivered, if the statement wasn\\'t considered tough enough, one\\n  might see a substantial outflow,\" buttrose said.\\n      offshore investors are eager to see australia take tough\\n  economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and\\n  stubborn current account deficit, analysts said.\\n      \"they are giving us the benefit of the doubt and i think\\n  they would like to leave the money here,\" buttrose said.\\n      reserve bank policy has also reflected the increased\\n  interest in investment in australia and the need to shield\\n  japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.\\n      reserve governor bob johnston last week acknowledged an\\n  element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency\\n  policy when he said authorities could not take their \"eyes off\\n  the yen\" because of the crucial role of japanese investors.\\n      analysts said they believed the reserve bank had worked\\n  successfully in recent months to keep the australian dollar\\n  within the range of 100 to 103 yen.\\n      apart from its recovery against a weak u.s. dollar, the\\n  australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a\\n  trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.\\n      offshore buying has also played a role in the booming\\n  australian share market. it has followed wall street and other\\n  markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the\\n  weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into\\n  equities, particularly in the gold sector.\\n      the key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3\\n  today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while\\n  the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the\\n  same period.\\n      the property sector is also sought after, with japanese\\n  companies that have invested heavily in the united states in\\n  recent years turning their attention to undervalued real\\n  estate, particularly in the tourism field.\\n      analysts pointed to the recent sale of sydney\\'s five-star\\n  regent hotel to japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs\\n  as indicative of the type of property being sought.\\n      \"they think they find good value real estate here which,\\n  with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of\\n  investment australia needs,\" buttrose added.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

feeling,\" said commerzbank ag chief economist juergen pfister.\\n      news on october 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct\\n  withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in\\n  a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and\\n  abroad.\\n      bankers said the bundesbank was angered by the way the\\n  finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the\\n  bundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting\\n  details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.\\n      both poehl, 57, and stoltenberg, 59, have been under\\n  extraordinary pressures lately.\\n      poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his\\n  deputy, helmut schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight\\n  inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had\\n  pursued so far this year to promote currency stability.\\n      in recent statements poehl has sounded more like\\n  schlesinger. for years the softly-spoken economist has been\\n  warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply\\n  growth would eventually lead to rising prices.\\n      schlesinger now has a majority of support in the bundesbank\\n  council, and since late summer poehl has had to represent his\\n  views, bankers said.\\n      \"poehl is in a minority in his own house,\" said commerzbank\\'s\\n  pfister.\\n      \"poehl is in a dilemma. he must follow a policy that is not\\n  entirely his own,\" said another economist.\\n      the dilemma is that if german interest rates rise too far,\\n  they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark\\n  and hurting west german exporters.\\n      the dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the\\n  bundesbank\\'s new tack became clear in early october.\\n      since last thursday, united states treasury secretary james\\n  baker has criticized the bundesbank rate increases.\\n      bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986\\n  war of words between the u.s. and west germany, in which u.s.\\n  officials talked down the dollar to force west germany to\\n  stimulate its economy and thus suck in more u.s. exports.\\n      one way west germany agreed to do this was making a round\\n  of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.\\n      but financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for\\n  stoltenberg than he had bargained for.\\n      the cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted\\n  most popular government politician last year, had to face\\n  resistance from local barons in the government coalition\\n  parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.\\n      the withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising\\n  4.3 billion marks.\\n      but it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will\\n  push up borrowing costs. the extra amount this costs the\\n  government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.\\n      meanwhile stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row\\n  which has turned into the country\\'s worst political scandal.\\n      stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in washington last\\n  month early to sort out a row in the northern state of\\n  schleswig-holstein, where he heads the ruling cdu party.\\n      the state\\'s cdu premier, uwe barschel, had to resign after\\n  allegations of a \"dirty tricks\" election campaign led to heavy\\n  losses for the cdu in state elections.\\n      barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in geneva last\\n  weekend. police say the death appears to have been suicide.\\n      cooperation between poehl and stoltenberg is all the more\\n  remarkable as poehl is in the opposition social democrats, and\\n  was appointed by former chancellor helmut schmidt.\\n      when poehl\\'s contract came up for renewal earlier this\\n  year, chancellor helmut kohl\\'s cdu-led coalition government\\n  gave poehl another eight-year term.\\n      werner chrobok, managing partner at bethmann bank, said he\\n  hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.\\n      but when poehl criticized stoltenberg\\'s tax plans he was\\n  not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the\\n  bundesbank\\'s independence of government, chrobok said.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

       " 'economic spotlight - dutch exchange rate policy\\n  recent slackness on dutch capital\\n  markets has led some bankers to question the central bank\\'s\\n  policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the west german mark\\n  and to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy.\\n      while agreeing with the bank\\'s commitment to defend the\\n  guilder strongly, some bankers want the bank to make more use\\n  of the range within which the guilder and the mark can\\n  fluctuate against each other in the european monetary system\\n  (ems).\\n      roelof nelissen, chairman of amsterdam-rotterdam bank nv\\n  (amro) said the central bank\\'s policy was overcautious.\\n      \"i would like to suggest that the bank use more freely the\\n  range given to the guilder in the ems,\" nelissen said at the\\n  presentation of amro\\'s 1986 annual report last week.\\n      within the ems, the mark is allowed to fluctuate against\\n  the guilder between 110.1675 and 115.235 guilders per 100.\\n      the central bank maintains a stricter policy and tries to\\n  keep the mark below the 113.00 guilders per 100. it regards a\\n  stable exchange rate as its main target, using interest rate\\n  policies to influence the exchange rate.\\n      the preference of exchange rate goals above interest rate\\n  aims goes almost undisputed in the netherlands.\\n      critics say the bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short.\\n      rabobank nederland said in its latest economic bulletin: \"by\\n  maintaining the 113.00 limit, the central bank raises the\\n  expectation it will always intervene above that level. if it\\n  suddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard to\\n  obtain.\"\\n      amro\\'s nelissen said relatively small changes in interest\\n  rates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows of\\n  securities business and sharp fluctuations on the dutch capital\\n  market. large interest rate changes were often needed to bring\\n  about small changes in the guilder/mark exchange rate, he\\n  added.\\n      unlike amro, algemene bank nederland nv (abn) says this is\\n  a price the dutch have to pay. it fully agrees with the central\\n  bank\\'s policy, director-general julien geertsema told reuters,\\n  noting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully with\\n  the mark in the ems hurt confidence in the dutch currency.\\n      \"it is a pity we need such a wide interest rate difference\\n  between west germany to maintain the exchange rate,\" he added.\\n      interest rate differentials between west germany and the\\n  netherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flows\\n  between the two countries, as the economic performance of the\\n  two does not differ much, economists said.\\n      data on 1986 capital flows between west germany and the\\n  netherlands have not yet been released, but in 1985 they\\n  accounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the two\\n  countries, put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by the\\n  dutch-german chamber of commerce earlier this month.\\n      economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interest\\n  and exchange rates.\\n      west germany is the netherlands\\' largest single trading\\n  partner, taking 28 pct of dutch exports and providing 26 pct of\\n  imports in the last quarter of 1986, central bureau of\\n  statistics figures show.\\n      at the moment, the rates for three month euromark deposits\\n  trade around 4.0 pct while the same deposits in guilders have a\\n  rate of around 5-7/16 pct.\\n      amro bank argues that the dutch real interest rate will\\n  even rise further because of expectations of deflation here in\\n  1987, contrasting with slight inflation in west germany.\\n      in the netherlands, the cost of living is expected to\\n  decrease by 1.5 pct at a gnp growth rate of two pct, the dutch\\n  central planning agency said in its 1987 forecast last month.\\n  german gnp is seen rising by two to 2.5 pct, but with inflation\\n  between zero and 1.0 pct, according to most german forecasts.\\n      but despite this upward push on real dutch rates, money\\n  dealers do not expect the central bank to cut official rates\\n  independently without prior moves by the bundesbank.\\n      following the west german interest rate cuts on january 22,\\n  the dutch central bank did not lower its rates but set a 0.5\\n  pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its credit\\n  surcharge. most traders were surprised by this move as they had\\n  expected the bank to follow suit unconditionally, they said.\\n      the bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impact\\n  on the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted.\\n      while not entirely unsympathetic to critics of its\\n  policies, the central bank keeps its grip firm and the range\\n  narrow.\\n      \"the european monetary system is not only a relationship\\n  between the guilder and the mark. many times widening of the\\n  margin between the two would implicate we have to buy or sell\\n  large amounts of a third currency,\" central bank vice-director\\n  jan-hendrik du

ready in early april. until last week, there\\n  were few indications the package would be ready anytime soon.\\n      the reagan administration, facing an uproar in congress\\n  over the apparent lack of progress in cutting the 169.8 billion\\n  dlr trade deficit, is learning now that to extract results from\\n  japan, dramatic action is required.\\n      last week the white house imposed unprecedented tariffs on\\n  certain japanese electronic goods after tokyo failed to adhere\\n  to a semi-conductor pricing accord between the two countries.\\n      the shift in u.s. strategy, in part designed to appease\\n  mounting congressional anger over japanese policies, comes just\\n  two weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to review\\n  the paris agreement to stabilize currencies.\\n      and news that japan earned a record 18 billion dlr trade\\n  surplus in the first two months this year just underscored the\\n  need for urgent action, in the view of u.s. officials.\\n      nonetheless, u.s. officials see signs of improvement in the\\n  deficit. \"i\\'d be stunned if we were not going to derive some\\n  benefits (from the lower dollar) soon,\" said one.\\n      in paris, leading industrial nations agreed to cooperate\\n  closely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting\\n  \"underlying economic fundamentals\" or economic reality.\\n      the agreement envisages those fundamentals to include japan\\n  and west germany stimulating their economies and the united\\n  states cutting its budget deficit.\\n      the three nations, joined by france, britain and canada,\\n  agree these policies are essential to redress huge global trade\\n  imbalances.\\n      but analysts say markets have signalled the underlying\\n  fundamentals imply a lower dollar, rather than a stable one.\\n      markets, in effect, are less confident than governments\\n  that these measures -- including u.s. budget deficit cuts\\n  agreed by congress and the white house --will be carried out.\\n      nonetheless, the dollar\\'s sharp fall has not undermined \\n  cooperation. a u.s. economic policymaker said the accord was on\\n  track and tokyo and bonn seem \"to want more stimulative measures\\n  which is what the paris accord calls for.\"\\n      international monetary sources said exchange market\\n  developments generally have not unsettled policymakers,\\n  although japan is an obvious exception. \"everybody feels it can\\n  still be managed,\" one source said of market developments.\\n      but last week, the bank of japan spent an estimated five\\n  billion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen, and other\\n  central banks about one billion dlrs.\\n      another monetary source said japan was upset with america\\'s\\n  half-hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar, flouting the\\n  paris accord outright.\\n      the source, close to the top levels of japanese economic\\n  policymaking, said japan\\'s understanding of the accord was that\\n  the yen would be kept at around 154 to the dollar, the level it\\n  stood at when the accord was struck.\\n      the source said tokyo was extremely worried by washington\\'s\\n  use of the exchange rate to change japanese policies. it was a\\n  \"pointed reminder\" to japan to do something about the trade\\n  issues, the source said of the dollar\\'s fall against the yen.\\n      by departing last sunday from the language of the paris\\n  accord -- that nations agreed to foster currency stability\\n  around current levels -- baker triggered a run on the dollar.\\n      later in the week, mulford too said there was no target for\\n  the dollar and called on japan and west germany to live up to\\n  their international responsibilities and stimulate growth.\\n      but u.s. officials said recent market developments will not\\n  unravel the spirit of the paris agreement.\\n      \"there\\'s a realisation now that you cannot leave things\\n  alone, everyone agrees that the external (trade) imbalances\\n  ought to be adjusted,\" one official said.\\n      \"while no-one is going to cede national sovereignty, we\\n  certainly seem to be moving towards much closer co-operation,\"\\n  another u.s. official said.\\n      the officials said the meeting here, where the six will be\\n  joined by italy, will be a status report.\\n      \"japan will have to explain what the state of their program\\n  is and germany will report on its plans. maybe there\\'s a need\\n  to move faster,\" one source said.\\n      mulford told congress last week the paris accord called, in\\n  effect, for currency stability for several months. this would\\n  buy time for japan and west germany to speed up their economic\\n  growth and help bring down the u.s. trade deficit.\\n      his comments appeared to serve notice on other major\\n  nations that washington cannot wait too long for action to\\n  reduce the gap between the

       " 'u.s. fed explores commodity basket index\\n  the complex task of wielding control\\n  over monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving global\\n  economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices, the\\n  newest member of the federal reserve board says.\\n      commodity prices are already considered by the fed in the\\n  making of monetary policy. but they would be given a much\\n  greater role under an idea being floated by governor robert\\n  heller, who joined the board last august.\\n      he conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, but\\n  argues that such an arrangement, particularly if it were\\n  adopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce the\\n  volatility of exchange rates.\\n      moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices of\\n  commodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation.\\n      his idea, which many conservative economists find\\n  appealing, has some backing among board members appointed in\\n  recent years by president reagan.\\n      it would complement the present system of opening or\\n  closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation,\\n  key indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall of\\n  the money supply. changes in the money supply can lead to\\n  changes in interest rates and affect economic activity\\n  directly.\\n      discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity concept\\n  is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary\\n  policy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid\\n  base.\\n      \"what is needed is an anchor or reference point that can\\n  serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary\\n  purposes,\" says heller.\\n      in the past, this anchor was gold but the united states\\n  went off the gold standard because the global economy had\\n  vastly outstripped gold supplies.\\n      a return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of\\n  hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest\\n  producers of gold are the soviet union and south africa.\\n      the so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early\\n  1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world.\\n      but the current system of floating currencies in which\\n  currencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to the\\n  monetary system, is also being widely questioned.\\n      some have suggested that the system might benefit from a\\n  formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when\\n  currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are\\n  major problems with this also.\\n      for one thing, there is justifiable concern that countries\\n  might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be\\n  detrimental to their own domestic economy.\\n      moreover, some question whether concerted intervention can\\n  make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree\\n  with the fundamental judgement.\\n      the poorest countries have called for a monetary conference\\n  to work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps them\\n  cope with their overpowering debt problems.\\n      treasury secretary james baker, the reagan administration\\'s\\n  chief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-called\\n  group of five industrial countries or sometimes, seven, as a\\n  forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other\\n  economic matters.\\n     he appears convinced that officials from west germany,\\n  france, britain, japan, italy and canada talking quietly behind\\n  closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public\\n  posturing.\\n     the heller approach, while extremely complex, could have a\\n  profound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices and\\n  international exchange rates.\\n      as envisioned by heller, a basket of say, 30 major\\n  commodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put together\\n  and prices would be measured on a regular basis.\\n      \"in times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might\\n  be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montary\\n  policy might be eased,\" he says.\\n      he notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction\\n  markets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on a\\n  virtually continuous basis.\\n      moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed and\\n  traded on a world-wide basis, so \"that an index has a relevance\\n  for the entire world,\" he says.\\n      in addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of the\\n  production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all\\n  production processes.\\n      \"focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive\\n  indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures,\\n  the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in\\n  making their monetary policy decisions,\" he says.\\n      however, he says that any major change in a basic

nine pct by midyear, which he considers unlikely.\\n      held said that, since late 1986, smith barney analysts have\\n  spoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher and\\n  they

belief that the rate\\n  rise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct by\\n  midyear. naturally, that would mean a sharp bond price fall.\\n      \"yields could rise further over the

as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollar\\n  and head off renewed inflationary psychology. that might harm\\n  the fragile u.s. economic expansion.\\n      the lanston economists said, \"the fed cannot ease its policy\\n  stance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calm\\n  domestic and third world debt jitters without the threat of\\n  causing a further decline in the

u.s. economic growth and the financial strains on u.s.\\n  banks resulting from their problem loans to developing\\n  countries rule out any fed policy firming.\\n      there is broad agreement among

weekend. traders also expect\\n  &lt;arab national bank> to step up london operations.\\n      traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market\\n  moving completely out of the region, partly
